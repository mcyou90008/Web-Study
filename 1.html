<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
  HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the
  document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: .[71][better source needed]
  In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
  and "end tag". The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
  Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of
  tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.
  The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information,
  such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information
  to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the used to embed images,
  the reference to the image resource.
