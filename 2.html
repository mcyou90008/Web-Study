<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[21] At the time,
  Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[22] Several other style sheet languages for
  the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside
  World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[23] being released
  in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and
  is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[24]
  Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized
  Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.
  [25] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different
  sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable.
  CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets
  by way of "cascading" styles.[25]
