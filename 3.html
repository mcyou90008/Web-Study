  he Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user
  interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth
  of the nascent World Wide Web.[10] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
  which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the
  most used browser.[11] During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,
  lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There
  was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995,
  Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
  this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also
  hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[12]
  Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with
  syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.
  [12] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were officially called
  LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator release in September 1995, the name was
  changed to JavaScript three months later.
